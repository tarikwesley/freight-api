  <b> Created to consult and calculate price and deadline freight. The api consume an external API being the <a href="https://viacep.com.br/"> ViaCep public API </a> to obtain the infos from zipcode. Java 8, Spring Boot, Mongodb and Docker were used for development.

Implemented for a SigaBem cargo transport company.

To calculate the total freight cost and expected delivery date.

Considering the following rules to calculate freight costs and delivery time:

- ZIPCODE's with the same DDDs have a 50% discount on freight and delivery is expected within 1 day
- ZIPCODE's in the same states have a 75% discount on freight and delivery in up to 3 days
- ZIPCODE's from different states should not be applied to the freight discount and expected delivery within 10 days
- The freight cost is charged according to the weight of the order, the value for each KG is R$ 1.00
- Your input must be ‚ÄúnameOfReceiver‚Äú, ‚ÄúzipCodeOrigin‚Äù, ‚ÄúzipCodeDestiny‚Äù and ‚Äúweight‚Äù.

<h2 id="started">üöÄ Getting started</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

<h3>Cloning</h3>

- After installing docker and git, clone the project with the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tarikwesley/freight-api.git
    ```

<h3>Starting</h3>

- Access the cloned project directory.
  - Run the command ```docker-compose up -d``` to have docker start the project services in the background.
- When you obtain the following status below, you will be able to test the application.

```bash
 ‚úî Network freight_network     Created
 ‚úî Container freight-mongodb   Started
 ‚úî Container freight-rest-api  Started
```

If the Mongo process ```freight-mongodb``` gives an error. Try disabling the mongo service on the local machine and try the previous command again.
Example: to disable the Mongo service on the local Linux machine:
Just run the command:
```sudo systemctl stop mongod```

Once everything is ok, continue the process.

- After this process, the API can be tested.
- To test API requests, you can use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).
- To close the application use the command ``` docker-compose down```.
